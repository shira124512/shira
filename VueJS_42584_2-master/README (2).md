# VueJS_42584_2



#### Front End Development with HTML5 & CSS3 
#### Course 42584 – 24 Hours

When dealing with Rich Internet Applications (RIA), development & technologies focus is moving from server to client side. The support for rich client applications reduces server loads and provides better response time and lower server development costs. In order to build rich client side applications correctly, getting familiar with JavaScript wide capabilities along with advanced CSS, HTML & jQuery features is essential. Building reusable, scalable and performance oriented JavaScript code requires a deep understanding of the language and as our applications grow more complex, this is no longer something we can live without.
<br>  
In this course we will learn the tools and patterns to build scalable JavaScript apps that will serve visitors from many platforms. We will get to know the various Ajax libraries and focus on jQuery to bridge the browser compatibility gap.

 

* Develop scalable, reusable and testable JavaScript code as the infrastructure for large scale web applications 
* Use the jQuery library for DOM access and Ajax  
* Develop AJAX based applications following the “one .html file” paradigm
* Use HTML5 and CSS3 to write modern web applications

 

This course is intended for back end developers who wish to focus on rich client-side techniques and frameworks.
